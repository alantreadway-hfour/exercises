# H4's collection of test exercises

This repo contains a collection of exercises that we sometimes use for demonstration and interviewing purposes. The repo contains only specifications, not the solutions.

If you've been tasked with one of these exercises, please complete it in a new github repo and send the link to whoever is your contact at H4.
